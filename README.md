### Description

- The Udacity's MyReadsProject demonstrates a Student's mastery ofusing React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.
- The Student is provided with a starter project containing some HTML, CSS, JavaScripts, and React files.
- The Student is responsible for creating a bookshelf app that allows an User to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository, or download the files to your computer.

### Local Development

1. `Node.js` runtime environment needs to be installed on your computer. Install by visiting [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en), or by using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm 'Node Version Manager - POSIX-compliant bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions') or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows 'A node.js version management utility for Windows. Ironically written in Go.') .

2. Install project dependencies.

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. After the installation is complete, use the following command to serve up the site.

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
